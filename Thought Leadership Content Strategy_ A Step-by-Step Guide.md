# Thought Leadership Content Strategy: A Step-by-Step Guide

Establishing a strong thought leadership presence requires a structured approach. This guide breaks down the process into seven actionable steps, helping you create high-value content that positions your company and subject matter experts (SMEs) as industry leaders.

## Step 1: Identify Core Topics

Before diving into content creation, define the topics you want to focus on. Your goal is to identify subject areas where your company can provide unique insights and valuable expertise.

### Resources to guide your topic selection:

- **Industry research**: Analyze emerging trends, challenges, and opportunities.  
- **Competitor analysis**: Identify content gaps that your competitors are not covering effectively.  
- **SEO insights**: Use tools like Ahrefs or Google Trends to discover high-impact keywords and search trends (e.g., Ahrefs SEO guide \- 1-hour video).

**Tip:** Keep an evolving list of potential topics. Prioritize those that align with your company’s expertise and customer pain points.

## Step 2: Match Topics with Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)

Once you have a solid list of topics, map them to internal experts who can provide in-depth insights.

### Considerations when identifying SMEs:

- **Start broad**: Don’t limit your selection based on availability or willingness to write—focus on expertise and passion first.  
- **Diversify your experts**: Assign multiple SMEs to each topic to ensure flexibility in case of scheduling conflicts.  
- **Look beyond the obvious**: Non-traditional voices (engineers, product managers, customer success leaders) can offer fresh perspectives.

**Tip:** If an SME is hesitant about writing, consider alternative content formats such as interviews, podcasts, or Q\&A-style articles.

## Step 3: Develop a Content Timeline

A structured timeline keeps your content strategy on track. Define a publishing cadence that balances quality and consistency.

### How to prioritize topics:

- **Event alignment**: Sync content with industry conferences, product launches, or PR opportunities.  
- **Relevance over time**: Consider which topics matter most now vs. six months from now.  
- **SME availability**: Some experts may have limited bandwidth—plan accordingly.

**Tip:** Start with a short-term plan (e.g., one quarter) before committing to a year-long roadmap. This allows for flexibility and refinement.

## Step 4: Engage Your SMEs

Now that you have topics and experts identified, it’s time to secure their participation.

### Steps to engage SMEs:

1. **Prepare a proposal** outlining the topic, its importance, and their role in content creation.  
2. **Send the proposal** and allow time for review.  
3. **Set a clear deadline** for their response.  
4. **Follow up** a day or two after the deadline if they haven’t responded.

**Tip:** Be persistent but flexible. SMEs are busy—gentle reminders and alternative collaboration formats (e.g., voice notes, interviews) can help.

## Step 5: Schedule and Prepare the Interview

Once the SME agrees to contribute, make the process as seamless as possible.

### Best practices:

1. **Develop a content framework**: Create an outline to guide the discussion and keep the focus sharp.  
2. **Send the framework to the SME** before the interview.  
3. **Offer scheduling flexibility**:  
   - Share your calendar link.  
   - Suggest a few time slots.  
   - Allow them to propose a time that works best.

**Tip:** Make the interview feel like a conversation rather than a formal Q\&A. This encourages natural insights and storytelling.

## Step 6: Conduct the Interview

A well-executed interview ensures you capture valuable insights with minimal friction for the SME.

### Interview best practices:

- **Record the session (with permission)** for reference.  
- **Take structured notes** to highlight key points.  
- **Keep it conversational**—this helps uncover unique angles and insights.  
- **Adapt to the SME’s style**:  
  - Some may prefer to talk through ideas while you draft.  
  - Others might prefer to write their own content with guidance.

**Tip:** The SME’s level of input will determine how much writing you need to do. Be prepared to fill in the gaps as needed.

## Step 7: Write and Refine the Content

Depending on the SME’s involvement, you may be drafting the entire piece or refining their work.

### If you are writing the piece:

1. Use your interview notes and framework to develop a compelling draft.  
2. Share the draft with an internal reviewer for feedback.  
3. Send the refined draft to the SME for review and approval.

### If the SME is writing the piece:

1. Provide them with a clear framework and key takeaways.  
2. Set a deadline for their first draft.  
3. Follow up if the deadline is missed.  
4. Review and refine their draft.  
5. Share with an internal reviewer for final feedback.  
6. Send back to the SME for final approval.

**Tip:** Balance clarity with the SME’s authentic voice—refine the content while maintaining their unique perspective.

## Final Steps: Editing, Publishing, and Promotion

1. **Final proofreading**: Ensure the piece is polished and free of errors.  
2. **Publish to the appropriate channels**: Blog, LinkedIn, company website, etc.  
3. **Promote strategically**:  
   - Share on social media.  
   - Repurpose for newsletters, white papers, or presentations.  
   - Engage with comments and discussions.

**Tip:** If you need help with distribution strategy, consider booking a consultation.
