Create content for thought leadership in 7 steps


Step 1


Select the topics you want to write about.


Resources
* Industry research
* Competitor research
* Ahrefs SEO guide (1 hour video)


Step 2


Match the topics with subject matter experts (SMEs) within your company.


Considerations
* Start with no restrictions, don’t worry about the likelihood they will write it, just start by matching people to topics they are knowledgable and/or passionate about.
* Include as many people for each topic as possible. This will help when you need to narrow down the list and start reaching out.


Step 3


Create a timeline. 


This could be for a quarter, 6 months, or the whole year. Up to you. I recommend starting small and coming back to this to extend it after you’ve created a piece or two of content with this process.


Prioritize topics based on the following factors:
* I like to compare the topics and SMEs I identified in steps 1 and 2 with my events calendar and any PR events.
* Which topics are most important right now? In 6 months?
* What are your SMEs calendars like? You will learn more about this after you prioritize and start reaching out to them in the next step.


See my example timeline.
Step 4


Engage your subject matter experts.


1. Create a proposal. Get my template.
2. Send your SME the proposal.
3. Give them a deadline to review and respond. Follow-up a day or two after the deadline if they have not responded. See my example correspondence.
Step 5


Schedule the interview.


After the SME has agreed to create thought leadership content with you:


1. Create a framework for your piece of content, whether it’s a blog post, web page, or white paper. This could be an outline or a more robust document. Get my example document.
2. Send to SME at the same time that you begin the scheduling process for the interview: ask how they would like to schedule the interview.


Give them a few options:
* Share your calendar with me
* I can send a few dates/times that work for me
* You can send a few dates/time that work for you


Step 6


Interview the SME.


Get my template.
Considerations
* Take notes and/or record the session.
* I like to think of this as more a conversation and less as an interview. It helps the SME relax and helps us find the right angle on a topic at the right time to focus on. This is an art not a science.
* The amount of information shared by the SME will differ from person to person.
* The amount shared will determine how much you need to write for them or how much the SME will be able to or want to write on their own.
* Some SMEs love to write and will want to do this, some will want your help to varying degrees.
* There is no right or wrong answer, but the answers influence how long it takes to create the content and how many revisions/edits may be needed.


Step 7


Create the piece of content.


If you are writing most or all of the piece:


1. Use your notes and/or recording to write the piece based on the framework you created in Step 5.
2. Share the piece with someone on your team for review and feedback; implement changes.
3. Share with SME for review and feedback; implement changes.


If your SME is writing most or all of the piece:


1. Use your notes and/or recording to update the framework you created in Step 5.
2. Share the framework with your SME and any notes or guidance you’d like to give before they get started.
3. Remind them of the deadline, and follow-up a day or two later if not submitted on time.
4. When you receive the draft, make comments/edits.
5. Share with someone on your team for review and feedback; implement changes.
6. Share with SME for review and feedback; implement changes.


Final steps


* Give everything a final copy edit for errors.
* Implement your content on appropriate channels.
